Taking GitHub Tutorial. Place for ideas.

Hey Everyone! This is my first time using git and GitHub.
I am currently learning computer science and I wanted to use this technology to keep track of my projects.
Hopefully, I will have much more to add in a few months, but curently I am just excited to start this process!
